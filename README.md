This was my first HTML5 game, using enchant.js and based on one of my favorite card games. Simply click on cards to switch them until each row is a pat hand.

Although the game itself is simple, I faced a potential problem since a purely random deal can result in an unwinnable hand. I wrote about this on my blog; the solution, encoded here, is discussed in this entry: http://www.aphorism44.com/blog/blogEntry.php?entryId=11.

The game did not prove popular when submitted to the Newgrounds portal. Also, I converted it into an Android app, but I did it manually (without PhoneGap), and it shows graphic glitches on a Samsung Galaxy S5.

While I was planning on someday using PhoneGap to correct the Android app's shortcomings, due to the unpopularity of the game, I have put it aside.
